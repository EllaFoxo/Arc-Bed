## Standard vs. Thermal Fused

The standard plate assumes you are using a silicone heater pad with an integrated 150C thermostat, so that the build plate is evenly heated. If you should wish to install a thermal fuse for added insurance, please use the thermal fuse version of the CAD for reference.

## Micron Bed Spacing

This plate uses the new 80mm spacing between extrusion pieces. Be sure to adjust your bed spacing to match if you have previously been using the older 60mm spacing.
